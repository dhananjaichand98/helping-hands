# Helping Hands

Hackathon project for TrojanHacks 2021 [[Demo Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03YToHQQ6uI)]

## Inspiration

As a team driven by the motive to contribute towards the greater good of LA, we aimed to create a project which would help unhoused and low income individuals by providing them with information regarding shelters and multiple charity events nearby.

## What it does
This web app automates the process of bringing help to the needy in a seamless and effortless manner never seen before. This is done by in three main steps:

- End user 1 - The unhoused and the low income individuals register and receive information about shelters and charity events through sms texts. Text messaging has been chosen as a means of interaction as studies show that nearly every such individual carries a phone with him/her however they might not have an active internet connection at all times.

- End user 2 - The donors - The app provides these users with the means to reach out and help the those in need. These users have also been provided with the functionality to create charity based events and to donate.

- End user 3 - The authorities - They are the validating entities that process every charity event request. Also, they act as facilitators of this system by helping the homeless find shelters whenever space is made available.

## How we built it

We used the following frameworks to create our web application 
- Python/Flask - To set up the backend 
- MySQL - To handle data related to unhoused and low income individuals, charity events, zip codes to calculate the lat/long, authorities and donors.
- Bootstrap 5 - To build the frontend
- Twilio API - To setup a two way texting system between our application and unhoused & low income individuals
- Google Maps API - To visualize data points according to the features designed for the application

## Challenges we ran into

- Obtaining Data Sets and interactive representation of data points according to zip code area in maps,
- Dynamically showing the requirements and events in those areas.
- Dynamic SMS service as a tool for registration/RSVP for suggested events.
- Writing thousands of lines of code from scratch and debugging through the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are most proud of having developed an application that helps serve the underpriviledged society, along with engagements and events organized by donors and the authorities. Because of covid-19, the most effected were the homeless and low income families who couldn't find shelter or required donations in the time of need.

## What we learned

We learned how to work in a team, popping up new ideas, quick decision making and a plethora of technologies while working on the project.

## What's next for Helping Hands

Scaling the system to an international level, payment service integration, engageSociety programs, real-time shelter space availability feature as well as expanding our customer base from low-income/homeless to people affected in other ways.
